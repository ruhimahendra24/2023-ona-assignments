# Discuss possible consequences of your choice of a seat. When would this choice be beneficial? When would it be not so beneficial?

My seat of choice would be seat B. This choice would be beneficial, because it has the highest betweeness, degree and closeness centrality out of all the available seats. Having a high betweeness centrality indicates that seat B is located in many paths between two seats. Due to this, if you choose seat B you can help facilitate communication. Seat B also has the highest closeness centrality, meaning that seat B has the shortest average path to the other seats, allowing for easy communication. Lastly, having a high degree centrality means that seat B has more than the average amount of neighbors, giving more options in who you want to talk to. If seat B is chosen, you are able to connect with 5 different individuals. Therefore, by choosing this seat you will have a very large network.

This seat my not be beneficial when you want to have a quiet morning on this bus because you did not get enough sleep the night before.
