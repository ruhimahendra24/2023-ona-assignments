### What is complex contagion, and how itâ€™s different from simple contagion?

Contagion refers to transferring an idea or behaviour from one or many individuals to another. Complex contagion requires an idea or action to be acquired by multiple neighbouring sources to be received by an individual. An example of complex contagion can be someone having a particular political view after conversing with multiple people who share the same political view. Simple contagion differs from complex contagion, where only one neighbouring source must identify with the idea or behaviour to transfer it to someone else. An example of a simple contagion is an individual trying a new restaurant because it was recommended by one of their friends. 

### What does complex contagion mean for the diffusion of behaviours in an organization?

In an organization, if a particular behaviour is prevalent amongst most individuals, it may take a while to be popular due to complex contagion. Therefore, for an individual to adopt a behaviour, they must be surrounded by several colleagues who acquire the identical behaviour. If a C-level executive wants a behaviour to be widespread within an organization, they should strategize how to spread this behaviour. An example within an organization can be where individual eats their lunch. If multiple colleagues eat their lunch at the cafeteria, this will pursue the individual to eat with their colleagues instead of alone at their desk. 

### How can we use the threshold models to manage better:
- Prosocial behaviour in organizations 
- Learning 
- Toxic or unproductive behaviours

Prosocial behaviour consists of helping, caring, encouraging, and comforting others. One way organizations can promote this behaviour is by identifying individuals who are susceptible to contagion. Once identified, someone should provide them with constant encouragement, and therefore they will follow suit. 

To manage learning within the organization, they can identify individuals who do not develop new ideas or do not take the initiative to learn. The organization can provide them with specific modules they want their employees to learn from; therefore, they are targeting knowledge within their employees. 

If cases of toxic behaviour are extreme and detrimental to the organization, individuals who display this behaviour must be removed. To deal with toxic or unproductive behaviours, organizations can identify individuals who are susceptible to contagion, specifically with toxic behaviours. Once identified, coaching and therapy can be applied to these individuals to help deal with this impact.
